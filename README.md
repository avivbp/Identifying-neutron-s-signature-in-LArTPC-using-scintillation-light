# Identifying-neutron-s-signature-in-LArTPC-using-scintillation-light

The goal of this research is to indentify neutron's signature in LArTPC in order to improve the energy reconstruction of neutrinos in neutrino oscillation studies.
LAr detectors cannot detect neutral particles such as neutrons with high efficiency, and this biases the energy reconstruction of the incoming neutrino.
